## RS3 UI Enhancement Mod

This mod aims to make the UI and some other features more like the original game and less like a phone game.
Included features:
* Font replacement for something sharper and closer to the SFC version.
* Combat UI arrangement more compact and closer to the SFC version.
* UI texture replacement using textures similar to the SFC version.
* Skill etc. descriptions display fully instead of scrolling.
* Stat buffs and debuffs are displayed similarly to status ailments. This feature can be disabled.
* 60 FPS. Some animations remain 30 FPS. Some animations are interpolated to 60 FPS, but that can optionally be disabled.
* Options for the above settings can be accessed by pressing Home on the keyboard in-game or from the settings file in AppData\LocalLow\SquareEnix\RomancingSaGa3.
* Speed toggle. Press R3 or PageDown to toggle between 1x, 2x and 3x speed. This option multiplies FPS. Field, battle and others save speed multiplier separately.
* Miscellaneous fixes such as a few incorrect tooltips, incorrect boss animation looping and incorrect parameters in a couple cutscenes.
* Japanese is also supported. 日本語にも対応。

Let me know if there are bugs or timings of animation being off.
