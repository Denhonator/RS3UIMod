## RS3 UI Enhancement Mod
This mod aims to make the UI and some other features more like the original game and less like a phone game.
Included features:
* Font replacement for something sharper and closer to the SFC version
* Combat UI arrangement more compact and closer to the SFC version
* UI texture replacement using textures similar to the SFC version
* Skill etc. descriptions display fully instead of scrolling
* 60 FPS movement and menus. Battles remain 30 FPS due to most battle animations being difficult to adjust.
* Speed toggle. Press PageDown to toggle between 1x, 2x and 3x speed. This option multiplies FPS. Field, battle and others save speed multiplier separately.

Let me know if there are bugs or something running at double speed.

### Install
You need something like MelonLoader https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader  
Then put the ReplaceTexture, rs3font and Mods folder from the releases page into the game folder (or compile the mod yourself with VS 2017)
